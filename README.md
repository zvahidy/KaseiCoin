# KaseiCoin
I was recently selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, I was chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. I am launching a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
The crowdsale contract that I created will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
